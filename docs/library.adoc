== Preface

The library contains various functions that can be used in `site.nix` and templates.

This file is generated with a link:https://github.com/styx-static/styx/blob/master/scripts/library-doc.nix[nix expression].

- link:./index.html[Styx documentation]

Library functions are grouped in namespaces, but are also all included in the top-level scope to be easily accessible. +
So for example, `lib.utils.chunksOf` can be shortened to `lib.chunksOf`.
