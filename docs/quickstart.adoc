== Quick Start

=== Preview a styx site

The styx showcase theme example site can be previewed by the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ styx preview-theme showcase
----

This command downloads the showcase theme to the nix store, builds the site (also in the nix store) and launches the preview from there.

The showcase example site will be accessible at link:http://127.0.0.1:8080[http://127.0.0.1:8080]. Check the posts as they provide some information about how styx works.

=== Create a new site

To create a new site, the following set of commands can be used:

[source, bash]
----
$ styx new site my-site # <1>
$ cd my-site # <2>
----

<1> Initialize a new styx site in the `my-site` directory.
<2> Enter the `my-site` directory.

A `readme.md` file will be available in the `my-site` directory giving basic instructions. Also the `styx doc` command will launch the documentation in a browser.

It is recommended to read the <<sitenix,site.nix>> section of this documentation to get familiar with how `site.nix` is structured and works.

Each theme of the `styx-themes` set provides an example site with a `site.nix` that can be checked in the link:./styx-themes.html[themes documentation].
