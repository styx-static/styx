[[Data]]
== Data

Data refers to the data fetched or declared in the <<site.nix-data,data section>> of `site.nix`.

Data is included in the default template environment and can be used in the pages section of `site.nix` to attach data to page attribute sets.

=== Creating data

Data can be created by directly defining a nix data structure. +
An example of such usage is a navbar declared as a list of page attributes sets.

[source, nix]
.Creating navbar data
----
  data.navbar = [ pages.about pages.contact ];
----

=== Importing data

The styx data library provides functions to import external data:

- link:library.html#lib.data.loadFile[loadFile]: load a single data file and return it as an attribute set
- link:library.html#lib.data.loadDir[loadDir]: to load all the files in a directory and return them as a list of attributes sets (non-recursive)

The data loading functions return a set per file loaded and do a few things:

* A `fileData` field is added that contains the file data as an attribute set with the following keys:
** `basename`: The base name of the file.
** `ext`: The extension of the file.
** `dir`: The directory of the file.
** `name`: The name of the file, `basename` and `ext` field combined with a `.`.
** `path`: The path of the file.
* <<data.metadata>> is automatically parsed and merged to the set.
* Data with <<data.introduction,introduction>> gain a `intro` attribute containing the introduction and the introduction is removed from the content.
* <<data.multipage,Multipages>> data gain a `pages` attribute, a list containing each page content.
* Converted markup is inserted in a `content` attribute.
* <<data.embedded-nix,Embedded nix>> expressions are evaluated.
* If the file basename begins in a `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` format, this value will be inserted in a `date` attribute.

NOTE: Nix data should be imported with the `import` function, that return the data in the nix file as it is.

=== Formats

This sections present the data file formats supported by styx.

==== AsciiDoc

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[AsciiDoc] is a simple but complete markup language.

It is the format of choice for complex posts or pages as it has more functionalities than Markdown.

[source, asciidoc]
.AsciiDoc example
----
= Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean dapibus aliquet justo ac lacinia.
----

The converted HTML will be in the `content` attribute of the data attribute set.

TIP: It is possible to add extra data to an AsciiDoc file by using <<Metadata>>.

NOTE: link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] is used to convert AsciiDoc.

==== Markdown

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] is a lightweight markup language.

It is the format of choice for posts or pages as it allows to write content in a simple manner.

[source,markdown]
.Markdown example
----
# Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean dapibus aliquet justo ac lacinia.
----

The converted HTML will be in the `content` attribute of the data attribute set.

TIP: It is possible to add extra data to a Markdown file by using <<Metadata>>.

NOTE: link:http://pandoc.org/[Pandoc] is used to convert Markdown.

==== Nix

Nix expression language is the language used in `site.nix` and in every template.

It is a simple functional language and fits well data that has multiple fields.

[source, nix]
.Nix data
----
[
  { name = "Alice"; interests = [ "science" "writing" ]; }
  { name = "Bob";   interests = [ "sports" "reading" ]; }
]
----

TIP: It is possible to make nix data a function and pass arguments from `site.nix`  such as `lib` for more flexibility.

====
Markup with metadata and nix data structures can be considered equivalent as it is possible to declare fields in nix data as markdown text, and markdown can declare nix fields as metadata.

Which one to choose is really a matter of choice but:

- Nix is well suited for complex data structures with multiple fields.
- Markup is well suited do content centric data.
====

[[data.drafts]]
=== Managing drafts

There a two main approaches to managing drafts with styx:

1. Managing drafts with metadata.
2. Managing drafts in a separate directory.

NOTE: Using metadata is the recommended way as it is easier to set up.

==== Metadata

This is the recomended way to manage draft contents. Drafts and regular posts are in the same directory, but drafts have a `draft` metadata key set to `true`.

[source, markdown]
.Mardown file marked as draft
----
---
draft: true
---
# Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean dapibus aliquet justo ac lacinia.
----

Then the list of posts can be fetched with link:library.html#lib.template.loadDir[loadDir] by passing the `renderDrafts` parameter.

[source, nix]
.Fetching drafts
----
  data = {
    posts = loadDir { dir = ./data/posts; inherit (conf) renderDrafts; };
  };
----

To "publish" a draft, its `draft` metadata should be set to false, or removed.

NOTE: If `renderDrafts` is not set, it will be assumed as `false` and automatically filter contents that have a `draft` metadata field set to `true`.

==== Directories

It is also possible to manage drafts in a separate directory. In this case `optionals` is used to load the drafts only if `conf.renderDrafts` is set to true.

[source, nix]
----
  data = {
    posts  = let
      posts  = loadDir { dir = ./data/posts; };
      drafts = optionals (conf.renderDrafts) (loadDir { dir = ./data/drafts; draft = true; });
    in sortBy "date" "dsc" (posts ++ drafts);
  };
----

To "publish" a draft, the content file should be moved to the non draft directory.

[[data.embedded-nix]]
=== Embedded nix

It is possible to embed nix expressions in markup files by surrounding them by `{{` and `}}`.

[source, markdown]
.Embedded nix in markdown
----
# Lorem ipsum

{{ toString (2 + 2) }}
----

The `env` parameter used in the `loadFile` or `loadDir` function is brought into scope, so `lib` functions or templates can be called. +
This is specially useful to embed external media in content.


[source, markdown]
.Calling a template in a markdown file
----
# Lorem ipsum

{{ templates.media.youtube { id = "YbUPdv03ciI"; } }}
----

`{{` and `}}` can be escaped by prepending a `\`, `\{{` and `\}}`, to prevent nix evaluation.

[NOTE]
====
Asciidoctor automatically escape HTML. This feature can be disabled by surrounding the code with `\+++`.

[source, asciidoc]
.Calling a template in an asciidoc file
----
= Lorem ipsum

+++{{ templates.media.youtube { id = "YbUPdv03ciI"; } }}+++
----
====

[[data.metadata]]
=== Metadata

Metadata is the way to attach Nix data to markup files.

A metadata block is a yaml attribute set opened by `---` and closed by `---`. +

[source,markdown]
.Adding metadata to a markdown file
----
---
date: "2016-10-10"
tags: [ "foo" "bar" ]
---

# Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean dapibus aliquet justo ac lacinia.
----

Metadata attributes will automatically be added to the data attribute set.

[[data.introduction]]
=== Introduction

It is possible to declare a section on an imported markup file as the introduction.

Introduction and main contents are separated by `[more]` (asciidoc) or `+++<!-- more -->+++` (markdown), content prior the separator will be inserted in the `intro` attribute of the data set. +

[source,markdown]
.Adding an introduction to a markdown file
----
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

<!-- more -->

# Lorem ipsum

Mauris quis dolor nec est accumsan dictum eu ut nulla. Sed ut tempus quam, vel bibendum lacus. Nulla vestibulum velit sed ipsum tincidunt maximus.
----

NOTE: `intro` field contents are included in the `content` field.

[[data.multipage]]
=== Multipage data

It is possible to split a markup file in multiple pages by using the `<<<` separator.

[source,markdown]
.Splitting a markdown file in 3 pages
----
# Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean dapibus aliquet justo ac lacinia.

<<<

# Cras malesuada metus

Cras malesuada metus quis mi pulvinar faucibus. Vivamus suscipit est ante, ut auctor tortor semper nec.

<<<

# Phasellus consequat

Phasellus consequat a nibh sit amet ultricies. Quisque feugiat justo eu condimentum convallis.
----

The resulting data set will have an extra `pages` field that will hold the list of subpages content in format `[ "..." "..." ... ]` in a `pages` attribute.

NOTE: The data section is only responsible for generating the data attribute set. Transforming a data attribute set in a page attribute set is done in the pages section. +
For example, the `mkPagesList` or `mkMultipages` function can generate pages from a multipage data set.


[[data.taxonomies]]
=== Taxonomies

==== Overview

Taxonomies are a way to group and structure data.

Styx taxonomies uses a two layers grouping system: taxonomies and terms. +
The *taxonomy* layer groups the content declaring a specific data attribute, and the *term* layer groups the contents in the taxonomy depending on the values set to that specific attribute.

A common example of taxonomy is tags, `tags` will be the taxonomy and `sports` or `technology` will be the terms.

Taxonomy are organized in the following structure:

* Taxonomy: Name of the grouping characteristic, for example `tags`.
* Term: Groups in the taxonomy, for `tags` it will contain the values tags can take, for example `sports` or `technology`.
* Values: Objects grouped by a taxonomy term, for example all the posts with the `technology` tag.

==== Creating a taxonomy data structure

A taxonomy data structure is created with the `mkTaxonomyData` function. +
This function take a set parameter with two required attributes `data` and `taxonomies`.

`taxonomies`:: A list of taxonomy fields to look for into `data`.
`data`:: The list of attribute sets (usually pages attribute sets) to where the `taxonomy` field will be looked for.

[source, nix]
.Creating a taxonomy structure
----
  data.taxonomies = mkTaxonomyData {
                      data = pages.posts;
                      taxonomies = [ "tags" "categories" ];
                    };
----

This will generate a taxonomy data structure where:

* `tags` and `categories` are taxonomies.
* terms would be all the values of `tags` or `categories` set in `pages.posts`.
* values would be all the pages in the `pages.posts` declaring `tags` or `categories`.

Then, the taxonomy related pages can be generated in the page section using the `mkTaxonomyPages` function.

NOTE: This example uses the `pages` and not `data` attribute sets because data attribute sets do not have a `path` field making it impossible to generate links to them. +
Using data attribute sets such as `data.posts` would make it impossible to generate pages from the taxonomy with `mkTaxonomyPages`.

====
The taxonomy data structure uses property lists, lists of attribute sets with a single key, for easier data manipulation.

[source, nix]
.Taxonomy data structure
----
[
  {
    TAXONOMY1 = [
      { TERM1 = [ VALUE1 VALUE2 ... ]; }
      { TERM2 = [  ... ]; }
      ...
    ];
  }
  {
    TAXONOMY2 = [
      { TERM1 = [ VALUE1 VALUE2 ... ]; }
      { TERM2 = [  ... ]; }
      ...
    ];
  }
]
----
====

==== Adding taxonomy to data

Adding taxonomy fields to a content requires adding a metadata attribute with a taxonomy name containing a list of terms.

[source,markdown]
.Setting tags to a markdown file
----
{---
tags = [ "foo" "bar" ];
---}

# Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean dapibus aliquet justo ac lacinia.
----


IMPORTANT: Taxonomy terms must be a list of strings.
