== Basics

Styx is using the Nix expression language.
The Nix expression language is a lazy evaluated functional language with unconventional semantics. It is recommended to read the link:http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-expression-language[Nix expression language chapter] of the Nix manual to get more familiar with it.

=== Configuration

Styx is configured with the `conf.nix` file present in the site root directory.

[source, nix]
.conf.nix
----
include::../sample/conf.nix[]
----

The configuration is an attribute set, and new configuration attributes can be added at will.

`pagesDir`:: Directory where pages are located.
`postsDir`:: Directory where posts are located.
`draftsDir`:: Directory where drafts are located.
`templatesDir`:: Directory where templates are located.
`staticDir`:: Directory where static files are located.
`siteId`:: Site id, used in the caching scheme. Should composed of lowercase letters, numbers, `-` and `_`. Spaces are not allowed.
`siteURL`:: URL of the site, must be set to the URL of the domain the site will be deployed. Must not contain a trailing `/`.
`siteTitle`:: Site title, used in the site header and the atom feed.
`siteDescription`:: Site description used in the base template.
`postsOnIndexPage`:: Maximum number of posts on the index page.
`postsPerArchivePage`:: Maximum number of posts per archive page.

[[defaultnix]]
=== default.nix

`default.nix` is the central file of a Styx site and is responsible for generating the website.

`default.nix` consists in a single function that generate a site when evaluated.

NOTE: Functions in the Nix expression language are declared in a `head: body` syntax, for example `a: b: a + b` is a function adding two numbers.

Sample site `default.nix` show many of the Styx possibilities, so might feel a little complicated for a new user.

A standard site `default.nix` can be lot simpler than the sample one.

The following sections will explain `default.nix` parts by parts.

==== Skeleton

The skeleton is the boiler-plate code of Styx, it should be edited at own risks as any change in it might lead to unexpected results.

[source, nix]
.`default.nix` skeleton
----
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} # <1>
, enableDrafts ? false # <2>
, siteUrl ? null
, lastChange ? null
}@args: # <3>

let lib = import ./lib pkgs; # <4>
in with lib; # <5>

let # <6>

# Main Logic # <7>

in generateSite { inherit conf; pages = pageList; } # <8>
----

<1> This is a function head declared as a deconstructed set, `?` righthand set the default value for the lefhand argument. This line is importing the default system nixpkgs.
<2> `enableDrafts ? false` means that `enableDrafts` default value is `false`.
<3> The `{ ... }@args` pattern provide a way to refer to the full parameter attribute set via `args`.
<4> `let` is a construction to declare local variables, a `let` block finish by a `in`. Any variable defined in a let is available in the let scope and in the scope right after the `in`.
`let a = 1; 1 + a` will result in `2`.
`let` are used to structure code in an easier to understand manner. This line import the `lib/default.nix` file and set it to a `lib` variable.
The `lib` variable is an attribute set containing Styx library functions.
<5> The `in` section of the previous `let`. The `with` coming next is a way to put all the top-level attributes of an attribute set in the scope. `with { a = 1; b = 2; }; a + b` result in `3`.
So in the previous line `lib` is imported in the `lib` local variable, and in this line all the top-level `lib` functions are inserted in the local scope.
<6> Another `let` to start a scope inheriting `lib` and all its attributes (top-level functions).
<7> Contains the main logic, and will be explained in the next section.
<8> This is what the whole `default.nix` function return. `generateSite` is a function that generate the site. All the logic in the "Main Logic" part is meant to prepare `generateSite` arguments.

WARNING: The default parameters in `default.nix` head: `pkgs`, `enableDrafts`, `siteUrl` and `lastChange` are set and expected by Styx. Removing or changing them will break the site generation process.

==== Main Logic

Main logic part can be divided in three parts: setup, template declaration and pages declaration.
The order of declarations in the main logic part is not important and can be changed to fit preference.

===== Setup

This part contains some boiler-plate code. Variables can be declared at will to fit any special needs.
(Comments removed in favor of call-out explanations)

[source, nix]
.Setup section in default.nix
----
  conf = overrideConf (import ./conf.nix) args; # <1>

  state = { inherit lastChange; }; # <2>

  genericEnv = { inherit conf state lib templates; }; # <3>

  loadTemplate = loadTemplateWithEnv genericEnv; # <4>

  navbar = [ (head pages.archives) pages.about ]; # <5>
----

<1> Loading the main configuration file, `conf.nix` in a `conf` local variable.
<2> Setting a `state` local variable containing "impure" values. It contains only the `lastChange` variable coming from `default.nix` main function head. (Skeleton point 1)
`lastChange` value is automatically set by the Styx command.
<3> This initialize a generic template environment. Most of templates expect to have access to `conf`, `state`, `lib` and `templates`. It is not recommended to remove any of these.
On the other hand it is fine to add new attributes to the default environment to fit special needs.
<4> Defining a helper function `loadTemplate` that loads a template with the default environment. This function is defined taking advantage of η-reduction so its argument is not specified.
`loadTemplate` is actively used during template declaration.
<5> This define a `navbar` local variable containing pages to include in the NavBar. For more details about Navbar setting, see the <<NavBar>> section.

NOTE: η-reduction is the process to drop a function abstraction. For example, `x: a x` is equivalent, and can be reduced to `a`.

===== Templates declaration

The template declaration part consists in declaring all the templates that will used. Templates are grouped in a single attribute set.

Template environment used to load templates can be extended on a per template basis to fit special needs.

The sample site contains many similar templates declarations, so this section will only present interesting examples.

[source, nix]
.Templates declaration
----
  templates = { # <1>
    index   = loadTemplate "index.nix"; # <2>
    layout  = loadTemplateWithEnv  # <3>
                (genericEnv // { inherit navbar; feed = pages.feed; }) # <4>
                "layout.nix"; # <5>
    navbar = { # <6>
      main = loadTemplate "navbar.main.nix";
      brand = loadTemplate "navbar.brand.nix";
    };
  };
----

<1> Declaring a `templates` attribute set where all the templates will be declared.
<2> Declaring an `index` variable that holds the `index.nix` template loaded with the generic template environment.
<3> Declaring a `layout` template that holds the layout template, this use the `loadTemplateWithEnv` function so a custom environment can be passed as the first argument.
<4> The environment passed to the template is the generic environment extended with a variable `feed` that holds the feed page (`pages.feed`) and the `navbar` variable that holds the list of pages to show in the NavBar.
The base template is managing the main layout of the site and the `head` section of the HTML document.
As we want to have a link to the feed in it, we add the feed page to a variable so it can be used in the template. Similar for the NavBar.
<5> The template file to load, `layout.nix`.
<6> Declaring templates in a sub attribute set. Templates in a subset can be accessed with `.`, for example the navbar main template is accessed by `templates.navbar.main`.

NOTE: `//` is the operator to merge attribute sets. If the two sets have a same key, the right hand set value will be set. The merge is not recursive.

===== Pages declaration

The pages declaration consists in declaring all the pages of the site in an attribute set.
The sample site contains many similar pages declarations, so this section will only present interesting examples.

A page is an attribute set with a few constraints, to learn more about how it should be structured see the <<Pages>> section.

NOTE: A page attribute set must consist at least of `template`, `href` and `title` attributes.
The feed page is an exception as it use the site title from `conf` and then does not need a `title` attribute.

[source, nix]
.Pages declaration 1/2
----
  pages = rec { # <1>
    index = { # <2>
      title = "Home";
      href = "index.html";
      template = templates.index;
      inherit feed; # <3>
      posts = take conf.postsOnIndexPage posts; # <4>
      archivePage = head archives; # <5>
    };

    about = {
      href = "about.html";
      template = templates.about;
      breadcrumbs = [ index ]; # <6>
    } // (parsePage conf.pagesDir "about.md"); # <7>
----

<1> Declaring the `pages` attribute set. It is important that this set holds only valid pages or list of pages.
The `rec` keyword make the set recursive, so it is possible to refer set attributes in other attributes.
<2> Declaring an index page containing the basic `title`, `href` and `template` attributes.
<3> Inheriting the feed page, this is equal to `feed = feed;`. `feed` is a non-standard page attribute and is declared to fit contents needs.
<4> This also set a non-standard attribute, `posts` set to the first `conf.postsOnIndexPage` items of the post page list.
<5> Another non-standard attribute, `archivePage` set to the first page of the archives page list.
<6> Setting page breadcrumbs, for details on the breadcrumbs system see the <<Breadcrumbs>> section.
<7> Fetching page content and title from a markdown.

[source, nix]
.Pages declaration 2/2
----
    archives = splitPage { # <1>
      baseHref = "archives/posts";
      template = templates.archive;
      items = posts;
      itemsPerPage = conf.postsPerArchivePage;
      title = "Posts";
      breadcrumbs = [ index ];
    };

    feed = { # <2>
      posts = take 10 posts;
      href = "feed.xml";
      template = templates.feed;
      layout = id;
    };

    posts = let  # <3>
      posts = getPosts conf.postsDir "posts"; # <4>
      drafts = optionals enableDrafts (getDrafts conf.draftsDir "drafts"); # <5>
      preparePosts = p: p // { template = templates.post.full; breadcrumbs = with pages; [ index (head archives) ]; }; # <6>
    in sortPosts (map preparePosts (posts ++ drafts)); # <7>
  };

  pageList =
    let list = (pagesToList pages); # <8>
    in map (setDefaultLayout templates.layout) list; # <9>
----

<1> Declaring an archives list of pages by splitting items trough multiple pages. See <<splitPage>> for details.
<2> A simple page declaration. As the feed template is using `conf.siteTitle` in place of `title`, it is not required to set a title in this special case.
Also, as the feed page does not need a layout, the layout function is set to `id`, see <<Layout templates>> for details.
<3> Declare the list of posts, this is the most complex page declaration presented in this section.
<4> Fetching the posts and setting their output path to `posts`.
<5> Fetching the drafts only if `enableDrafts` is enabled. (by using the Styx command `--drafts` flag)
<6> Declaring a `preparePost` function that take a post and extends it by setting a template and breadcrumbs.
<7> Finally merging the posts and drafts in a list, setting the template and breadcrumbs to each, and sorting the list so the posts are in chronological order.
<8> `generateSite` needs a list of pages, so we convert the `pages` attribute set to a `pageList` list with the `pagesToList` function.
<9> Then, `setDefaultLayout` is used to set a layout template to all the pages that don't set the `layout` attribute.
