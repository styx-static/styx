# Orbit Theme

This is a Styx port of [Orbit](//github.com/xriley/Orbit-Theme) - great looking resume/CV template designed for developers by Xiaoying Riley.

---

Most of the theme can be configured with the configuration interface defined in `theme.nix`.

For example, to change the title in the navigation:

```
{
  theme.site.title = "John Doe";
}
```
