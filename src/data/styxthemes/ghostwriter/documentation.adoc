== Setting a navigation

Main navigation will be automatically created with the contents of `site.nix` `data.menu` contents.  
`data.menu` should be a list of pages or equivalent attributes sets defining at least the `title` and `url` attribute.

[source, nix]
.Declaring a menu
----
  data = {
    menu = [
      (head pages.index)
      pages.about
      { title = "Foo"; url = "/foo.html"; }
    ];
  };
----

== Adding author information to posts

An author is an attribute set consisting of a `name` and `url` attribute. (The `url` attribute is optional).
It is possible to set the author per post using markup file metadata:

[source, nix]
.Setting author via metadata
----
{---
title = "My post";
author = {
  name = "John Doe";
};
---}

# Lorem ipsum
----

It is also possible to create author data defined in `site.nix`.
For example, if there is the following declaration in `site.nix`:

[source, nix]
.Declaring author in site.nix
----
data = rec {
  authors.john = {
    name = "John Doe";
  };

  posts  = sortBy "date" "dsc" (loadDir { dir = ./posts; env = (env // { inherit authors; }); });
};
----

IMPORTANT: `authors` must be passed to the `env` of the function responsible of loading the posts. 

Then `authors.john` can be used in the metadata:

[source, nix]
.Setting author via metadata
----
{---
title = "My post";
author = authors.john;
---}

# Lorem ipsum
----

In case of a single author, it is possible to automatically set the same author to every post in `site.nix` during the posts pages creation.

[source, nix]
.Setting author during pages creation
----
posts = mkPageList {
  data        = data.posts;
  pathPrefix  = "/posts/";
  template    = templates.post.full;
  author      = { name = "John Doe"; };
};
----
