Example of a draft page.

>>>

This page will only be rendered if the `--drafts` flag is passed to styx.

From a data perspective, drafts are similar to posts. The only difference is that `extraConf.renderDrafts` flag is set to true when drafts are enabled.

```
data.drafts = optionals (conf ? renderDrafts) (loadDir { dir = ./data/drafts; isDraft = true; });
```
