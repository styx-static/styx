## What are pages

Pages are attribute sets with a `template`, `layout` and `href` attribute.

- `href`: determines the path of the page.
- `template` and `layout` are the templates used to render the page.

Page attribute set is first passed to the template, and that result is passed to the `layout` and output in `href`.

Pages can be created from data, or from plain templates.

The standard library provide helper functions to generate different types of pages:

- `mkSplit`: to split data through multiple pages, useful to make archive pages.
- `mkPageList`: to generate a list of pages from a list of data.
- `mkMultipages`: to split a single data piece between multiple pages.
- `mkTaxonomyPages`: to generate taxonomy pages from taxonomy data.
