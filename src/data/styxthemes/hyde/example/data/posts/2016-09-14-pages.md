## Styx pages

A styx page is an attribute sets with at least a `template`, `layout` and `path` attribute.

- `path`: determines the path of the page.
- `template` and `layout` are the templates used to render the page.

Page attribute set is first passed to the template, and that result is passed to the `layout` and output in `path`.

Pages can be created from data, or from plain templates.

The standard library provide helper functions to generate different types of pages:

- `mkSplit`: to split data through multiple pages, useful to make archive pages.
- `mkPageList`: to generate a list of pages from a list of data.
- `mkMultipages`: to split a single data piece between multiple pages.
- `mkTaxonomyPages`: to generate taxonomy pages from taxonomy data.

For more details refer to the [pages](https://styx-static.github.io/styx-site/documentation.html#Pages) chapter of styx documentation.
