## Clean separation of concerns

Styx has a clean separation of concerns.

on a file level:

- `site.nix` handles all the logic of the site generation.
- `conf.nix` manage the theme and other settings.
- `themes` manage templates and static files.
- Every data is managed in its own file.

On a logical level, in `site.nix`:

- The `data` section handle external data fetching.
- The `pages` section handle the page generation from data or from scratch.

To preview the site after a change, the `styx preview` command ca be used.

Other posts will introduce `themes`, `data` and `pages`.


## Flexibility

Styx does not enforce any data or site structure. You are totally free to do whatever you want.

Also, the site generation function provides hooks that allow even more use cases, Styx site use the `postGen` to generate every styx version documentation.
